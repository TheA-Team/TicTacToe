# **Design Report**

In this project we are making the popular game TicTacToe, that everyone knows and loves. Our main goal was to make a game that is simple and works. We stored all our code on a public repository on Github from the start of the project also we used automatic build process that runs all the unit tests. These tests has to be successful and one team mate has to review it and accept it so it can be pushed to Github. Since we have families we couldn't always meetup in one place so we used google hangouts, which includes screen sharing, to chat.
 We also used automated continuous integration server Travis.


### Programing rules
At the start off this project we came together and and decided on a few programming rules. These rules are in place to help us write code that is easy to read and understand which will help to avoid possible errors.       


### Java rules
Camel case must be used on Variables- and functions names.
All names must be written in english.
Variables- and function names must be descriptive.




### Operating and development environment

**Github:**
Is a web based version of Git repository hosting service. It offers all of the distribution revision control and source code management functionality of G as well as adding its own features.
**Google docs:**
Is a web based word processor we used to make our reports, which makes all team members able to work on them at the same time.
**Google hangouts:**
Is proprietary voice-over-internet protocol (VoIP) software that allows computer users to speak on a chat channel with fellow computer users, much like a telephone conference call.
